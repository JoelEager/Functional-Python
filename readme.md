# Functional Python
*An introduction to solving the worldâ€™s problems with iterators.*

This repo contains the slides and code examples for my seminar on functional programming in Python. The intention is 
that you can follow along in the examples during the talk and then reference them in the future when you try writing 
functional Python code of your own. However, this can be used as a self-guided introduction if you just read through 
the slides and examples.

## Setup
All you need for these examples is **Python 3.3** or newer. Just clone the repo and run it.

## Contents
Below is a breakdown of what this repo contains. The files are listed in the recommended order for reading and working 
through the content:
* `slides.pdf` - Provides a general introduction to what functional programming is and how it relates to Python.
* `examples/functions.py` - Shows how functions in Python are also objects and what that allows you to do.
* `examples/decorators.py` - Demos function composition using Python decorators and nested functions.
* `examples/iterators.py` - Makes use of python built-ins and the `itertools` modules to show how to process data 
through iterators.
* `examples/comprehensions.py` - Shows an alternate use of iterators to populate Python data structures in a compact 
and readable way.
* `examples/custom_iterators.py` - Now that you've seen iterators from the outside it's time to create some of your own.
* `examples/generators.py` - Demos one of the lesser known Python features that allows you to turn functions into 
iterators.

## Further reading
Much of the content and structure of this seminar is based on the 
[official Python functional programming how-to](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html).
It's a great resource so if you're looking for more check it out.
